	<h1 style="color:blue" > JavaScript  </h1> 
	
	<p > was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
	
	<p >
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
</p>
	<p >Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.</p>
	<h1 style="color:blue">History of java script</h1>
	<p >: It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.</p>

	<h1>Platform for JavaScript:</h1>
	<h3 style="color:blue">Web Development: </h3>
	<P>Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
</P>
	<h3 style="color:blue">	Web Applications: </h3>
	<p>With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this department.</p>
	<h3 style="color:blue">Server Applications</h3>
	<p>With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the most powerful in the server-side.</p>
	<h3 style="color:blue">	Games: </h3>
	<p> Not only in websites, JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.</p>
